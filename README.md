# Smart-Crop-Recommendation-System
The Smart Crop Recommendation System is a rule-based expert system developed in Python, originally implemented in Prolog, designed to help farmers choose the most suitable crop based on environmental conditions.
The system takes four essential inputs—soil type, season, rainfall, and soil pH—and compares them against a predefined knowledge base of crop requirements.
It features rule-based knowledge (converted from prolog facts), Python implementation of Prolog reasoning, interactive CLI (input-based interface), instant crop recommendations, easy-to-edit crop dataset and beginner-friendly and works on any OS.
Its mechanism works in the following way: The program contains a list of crops and their requirements i.e. soil type, season, rainfall range and soil pH range. Then, the user enters environmental parameters, and the system matches them to crops using simple rule logic.

Prolog facts → Python dictionaries. 

Prolog rules → Python condition checks. 

Future enhancements using this system involve using machine learning models, adding a GUI or web application, weather API integration, fertilizer recommendation and disease prediction module.
